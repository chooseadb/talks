<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = NO -->

## Underlying Code {auto-animate=true data-menu-title="Underlying Code (i)"}

<!-- vale RedHat.TermsWarnings = YES -->

```{.json code-line-numbers="1|2-3|5|7"}
:: Start the adventure {"position":"900,525","size":"100,100"}
A courier delivers you a magical bag which stores many things.
Perhaps you should already have something in there.

Do you have some data?

[[yes|data-yes]] / [[no|data-no]]
```

## Underlying Code {auto-animate=true data-menu-title="Underlying Code (ii)"}

```{.json code-line-numbers="9-11|13-19"}
:: Start the adventure {"position":"900,525","size":"100,100"}
A courier delivers you a magical bag which stores many things.
Perhaps you should already have something in there.

Do you have some data?

[[yes|data-yes]] / [[no|data-no]]

:: data-no {"position":"1050,525","size":"100,100"}
Oh no! Perhaps you should collect some!
You can [[return to your journey another time|Start the adventure]].

:: data-yes {"position":"900,650","size":"100,100"}
You look around and spot a tavern.
There may be other travelers who wish to join your party.

Do other people need to write to your data? (Yes, this includes users.)

[[yes|edit-yes]] / [[no|edit-no]]
